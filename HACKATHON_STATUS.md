## ⚠️ Known Non-Critical Issues

### Middleware Deprecation Warning
```
⚠ The "middleware" file convention is deprecated. Please use "proxy" instead.
```
- **Impact:** None - just a Next.js warning
- **Status:** Will migrate to proxy.ts post-hackathon
- **Does not affect functionality**

### Multilingual Infrastructure
- next-intl routing exists but UI not migrated
- URLs like `/vi` work but display English
- **Decision:** Shelved for post-hackathon completion
- **Why:** Focus on core stability for demo

### Places API 403
- Some Google Places API calls return 403
- **Impact:** Minimal - fallback systems in place
- **Cause:** May need additional API key permissions
- **Does not block core gameplay**

## 🎬 Talking Points

### Opening
"GeoSeeker transforms any city into an AI-powered scavenger hunt. Enter a location, and Gemini 3 generates culturally-relevant quests with 16-bit pixel art."

### Technical Deep Dive
"We're using three Gemini 3 models: Flash for quest generation, Flash Vision for photo verification, and Pro Image for pixel art. The appeal system solves AI hallucination by letting users provide context."

### Innovation Highlight
"The GPS-enhanced verification combines computer vision with real-world location data. If you're within 30 meters of the target, the AI is more forgiving about visual details."

### Real-World Impact
"We tested this in Da Nang and discovered the AI requested blue lifeguard stations when they're actually green. The appeal system let us explain that and continue playing - no game-breaking bugs."

### Future Vision
"With $290 in Google Cloud credits, we can add Veo 3.1 video generation for cinematic quest reveals, plus user video/audio submissions for multi-modal verification."
